#  Learning to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions

## Tools- Microsoft Edge

## List of suspicious extensions found and removed

1. Ublock Origin

2. AdBlock

3. Netflix Party is Now Teleparty

## Reasons to remove the extensions

1. The AdBlock asked "permission to operate on every website you visit" and "read and change all your data on all websites": These are the most poerful permissions a browser extension can request, it can introduce a security risk if the extension is malicious or compromised and it also increases the attack surface.

2. The Ublock Origin asked "permission for read your browsing history": These permission would allow the app to viwe the websites or access the websites you visit, which if gets compromised,it could spy on browsing habits.

3. The Teleparty asked for "Automatically allowed access" and "read browsing history": These permissions could access more sites than needed if given access and then it could misuse it and it can also inject malicious ads.

## After removal of the extensions

1. I went to the extensions clicked on the "remove" option and the particular extension stopped working. My browser started working smoothly than before and unecessaru ads also stopped appearing.
